"""
MicroPython driver for the SCD41 CO2, Temperature Sensor and Humidity Sensor

This was built using the micropython_ahtx0 driver by Andreas BÃ¼hl & Kattni Rembor as a guide:
https://github.com/targetblank/micropython_ahtx0
And was built following the datasheet at:
https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-CO2&Temperature&HumiditySensor-SCD4/res/Sensirion_CO2_Sensors_SCD4x_Datasheet.pdf

This driver can be used like so:
    thc_sda = machine.Pin(14)
    thc_scl = machine.Pin(15)
    i2c1 = machine.I2C(1, sda=thc_sda, scl=thc_scl, freq=100000)
    thc_sensor = SCD41(i2c1)
    print("co:", thc_sensor.carbon_dioxide, "temp:", thc_sensor.temperature, "rh:", thc_sensor.relative_humidity)

Requesting any of the values will initiate the sensor start its internal measurement cycle.
Sensor measurements are updated every 5s, although you can call request values sooner via your
class instance and the instance will:
  - Provide fresh results if the sensor has them ready.
  - Otherwise provide cached results if last fetched in the last 5s.
  - Otherwise wait until the sensor has new results to fetch.

The sensor requires a 1000ms power-on time. This driver assumes power-on at time of initiation.
If a reading is then requested, it will wait for the remainder time since initiation to ensure this time.
Between power-on and sensor-read delays, your first request of sensor data may cause a delay of up to ~6500ms.

While this sensor provides various interfaces for calibration and settings, this driver does not currently
provide methods for those.
